            <p>VideoSearch is an innovative platform designed to make your video content easily searchable. By leveraging advanced subtitle extraction and keyword search capabilities, our application allows you to upload videos, process them in the background, and search for specific words or phrases within the video. Whether itâ€™s a music video, a lecture, or any other type of video content, VideoSearch ensures you can quickly find the exact moment where a particular phrase is mentioned.</p><br/>

                Upload Your Video: Start by uploading your video file. Our platform supports various video formats.<br/>
                Background Processing: Once uploaded, our system uses the ccextractor binary to extract subtitles from your video. This process happens seamlessly in the background.<br/>
